# EduGen

EduGen is a microservices-based application aimed at supporting the learning process. The project consists of two main Python microservices, leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with LLM (Large Language Model) to generate educational content such as quizzes, learning plans, summaries, and cheat sheets.

## Project Description

EduGen is an application that assists the learning process by generating personalized educational content. The project consists of two microservices:
- `pdf_processing_service` - Responsible for processing PDF documents, generating embeddings, and indexing them.
- `rag_llm_service` - Integrates with the LLM model to generate quizzes, learning plans, summaries, and cheat sheets based on the provided material.

## Architecture

The project is built based on microservices that communicate via REST APIs. Each microservice has a dedicated responsibility:
- **`pdf_processing_service`**: Handles PDF documents, extracts content, generates embeddings, and stores them in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone).
- **`rag_llm_service`**: Uses LLM to generate educational content based on the provided data.

The microservices will later be integrated via an API Gateway, such as **Ocelot**, and the entire system will be scaled in a microservices architecture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pipenv / venv for virtual environment management
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt` for each microservice
- API key for OpenAI (for LLM integration)
- Pinecone account (optional, for storing embeddings)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kottoization/EduGen.git
cd EduGen
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

#### `pdf_processing_service`

```bash
cd pdf_processing_service
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix systems
# .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### `rag_llm_service`

```bash
cd ../rag_llm_service
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix systems
# .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Microservices

### `pdf_processing_service`

Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
cd pdf_processing_service
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### `rag_llm_service`

Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
cd rag_llm_service
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8002
```

Each microservice will be available on the respective port (e.g., `http://localhost:8001` for `pdf_processing_service`).

## Testing

To test the modules, use `pytest`.

### Example of Running Tests:

#### `pdf_processing_service`

```bash
cd pdf_processing_service
pytest tests/
```

#### `rag_llm_service`

```bash
cd rag_llm_service
pytest tests/
```

## Technologies Used

### Notes

- Make sure the `.env` file is correctly configured before running the microservices.
- Adjust configuration parameters in `config.yaml` files and other settings as needed for your project.
- Before deploying to production, test the scalability, performance, and security of each microservice.
